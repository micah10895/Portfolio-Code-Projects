The Build 4.4 folder contains the executable to run the game.
The Scripts folder is all the code I did for this project.

This project is by no means completely finished there are future plans for this project.
For now it serves as a playable demo for my portfolio to show and/or demonstrate a portion
  of my current abilities and as a Game Developer.
