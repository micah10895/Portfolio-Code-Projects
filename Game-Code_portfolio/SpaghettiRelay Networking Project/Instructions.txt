Instructions to successfully run this program.

- open two instances of the program (either on the same computer or on 2 different computers)

- You can use any Private IP address assigned to your network (If you're not sure about IP's)
  I recommend just keeping the one selected) both instances need to have the same IP

- Same goes for the port

- One must be in server mode and the other in client mode

- On the Server hit the listen button and then on the Client hit the connect button
  now you should be able to send messaegs between the server and the client.
